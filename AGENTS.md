# AI Video Studio

User instructions and the current brief take priority. This is a local, chat-driven creative workspace. The website organizes work and review decisions; it does not edit a dropped file or send a request to an AI automatically.

## Start and resume

Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, README.md, docs/WORKFLOW.md and docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md. For existing work, read projects/<slug>/STATUS.md, approval-state.json when present, brief.md, current storyboard/design and latest review notes. Read SETUP.md for installation and docs/TOOLING.md before media commands. Never rely on a previous chat, open browser, old port or filename as approval evidence.

For software changes or publication, read docs/RELEASE.md; for an installed studio upgrade, read docs/UPDATING.md. Work on a branch, review a pull request, pass the checks, then merge and publish a numbered release when authorized. A source merge and a published release are separate steps. New installations start empty; updates preserve existing owner data. These procedures belong in shared Markdown instructions, never in .env or a private chat alone.

## Work with the creator

- Raw takes: compare performance, gestures and delivery; assemble complete thoughts with tight natural joins. Silence detection only proposes regions. Deliver a watchable spoken cut and script before visual storyboarding.
- Already approved speech: preserve words/timing unless asked to recut.
- Show actual proposed storyboard frames, copy, source choices and motion/sound intent before detailed production when requested. Questions and no-change requests are conceptual only.
- Add captions, genuine product B-roll, purposeful motion/zooms/transitions and sound effects. Music follows the brief. Do not invent UI and present it as a real demonstration.
- Verify product names, numbers, caption timing after cuts, headroom and safe areas. Listen/inspect actual source and exports when supported; state perception limits instead of claiming a complete review.
- The user reviews the cut, direction and final. Stage approval is not final approval. Reopening preserves the accepted files and creates a new change round.

## Files and tools

- Source files in projects/<slug>/raw are immutable. Copy imports. Keep proxies, source-to-output maps, selects, captions, rights/source ledgers, code and versioned exports. Never overwrite a deliverable silently.
- Use python3 scripts/studio.py new <slug> to scaffold and register an intake project. Use that project's .venv Python for Pillow/media helpers. The site itself only needs Python's standard library.
- Use the project-local pinned HyperFrames CLI through scripts/hf.py. Read its official docs and installed capabilities before changing production architecture. Each composition has a finite duration, one paused seekable timeline and local production assets.
- Do not assume private globally installed skills/plugins, paid libraries or accounts. Shared docs and the sample are sufficient for the baseline. Optional capabilities need the user's own account/rights. Do not weaken approval/security settings or install global integrations as part of setup.
- Detect HDR before SDR output; preserve a deliberate color workflow. Synthetic smoke media proves technical behavior only, never take selection or creative quality.

## Studio and reference upkeep

Read docs/HANDOFF.md and style-library/PROJECT-NAVIGATION.md. After saving production decisions, register current files/checkpoints and source-note hashes. Registration does not approve anything. Never refresh stale fingerprints without reading changed notes.

A pasted library URL resolves #style, #technique/example or #project/artifact/frame against this workspace's registries; inspect the actual referenced media and notes. Localhost links do not upload or share files with another computer. The + selects only in this browser; Copy for chat copies the exact library link and its saved borrowing notes; Review selected references combines sources and notes. Preserve the exact chosen example. General receiving instructions belong here, not in long copied boilerplate.

Maintain one representative entry for a first full review (review_pending), and update the preferred version after explicit positive user feedback. Preserve an accepted baseline while a new experiment is pending. Add creator references explicitly supplied as inspiration; deduplicate original URLs, retain creator attribution and honest evidence limits. Outside footage/audio is reference-only unless separately authorized and licensed.

## Handoff and publishing

Save STATUS, review notes, exact build commands, accepted/newest versions and limitations. Explicit approvals saved by the website are authoritative for that exact checkpoint. Do not approve real projects as a UI test. Test mutations only in temporary fixtures.

Never publish, push to a remote, message anyone or share private media without user authorization. Owner projects, catalogs, approval journals, credentials and references are ignored and excluded from release exports. See SECURITY.md and docs/RELEASE.md before packaging. No background monitoring is implied.

## References saved from the UI

Add reference saves a public source URL and optional title/creator/reference_note into the local catalog. The UI then tries the public page’s declared cover image through a bounded HTTPS request. No video is downloaded or analyzed, no account is used, and analysis_status stays not_analyzed. Failed cover retrieval quietly keeps a state-aware placeholder: Ready for analysis while unexamined, Preview not saved when partial, or Video preview unavailable for other saved sources. Cover availability and analysis status are independent. Copy analysis request explicitly copies a request; it does not invoke an agent. When receiving it, resolve the exact existing ID, read reference_note, inspect actual source media where accessible and enrich that same record. Preserve the source identity, user note and collection; deduplicate before adding anything. Record evidence and limitations. Set analysis_status to partial/analyzed only for work actually inspected; inaccessible links stay pending. For a genuine local preview, assign a new versioned source-backed poster, paths/duration and source evidence, then recheck linked technique snapshots. Never infer sound/fonts/timing from an unviewed link or create a fake playable preview. External media rights remain project-specific. UI editing changes only basic details and preserves existing analysis; saved note/revision checks prevent stale edits overwriting a later analysis.

## Available capabilities

Read docs/CAPABILITIES.md and the setup report. Check the actual tools in the current chat before assuming browser, image-generation or account access. Guide an explicitly authorized official prerequisite installation; do not silently install global tools. The render browser is separate from source browsing. If a site needs login, let the user sign in in the connected browser; if access fails, request a usable source/file and retain honest pending analysis. Basic clicks/pops/whooshes can be synthesized with local code/FFmpeg; audition them and record provenance. Use optional services only when available and authorized, and ask before paid usage. No setup script can grant personal account access.

## Saved review feedback

The studio saves timestamped video notes or storyboard/slide notes to projects/<slug>/review-feedback.json. Saving never starts an edit, changes approval or publishes. When asked to apply saved feedback, read that file alongside the current STATUS.md, approval-state.json and exact registered artifacts.

Copy feedback for chat now prepares a friendly request with one local project URL containing #project=<slug>&artifact=<version-id>&feedback=<selection-id>. The all-project alternative omits artifact. Resolve feedback in projects/<slug>/review-feedback-links.json, under links[selection-id]. This immutable record contains the exact project_id, artifact_id (null for all-project), artifact_ids and full note_ids; verify them against this project and its notes. Do not substitute all current notes for a missing, malformed or mismatched selection. Report unavailable IDs. Read the link file directly if the server is stopped; localhost links do not upload or share these files across computers.

Apply matching notes whose status is open and which have no deleted_at marker. Recognize already-applied notes when a request is repeated. This selection scopes the saved feedback being shared; additional instructions the user supplies remain authoritative and should be handled too. Legacy copied Feedback selection JSON remains supported under the same exact-ID checks. Generic requests without a selection still require the named project and current review context.

Preserve each note's artifact ID/version/time/scene/source. Older-version feedback is context, not permission to overwrite an accepted final. After implementing and verifying a note, retain its text and ID, mark it applied, and record the resulting version/verification in applied_in and review-notes.md. Unresolved notes stay open with an explanation. Preserve all other notes, link records and request/history fields. Never apply notes merely because they exist. Both assistants can read these local files without a direct chat connection.

Saved notes can be edited inline or reversibly deleted. Preserve their IDs, source/version/time/scene, application state and the append-only history snapshots. A deleted_at marker excludes a note from application and copying; never remove the record. Undo/Restore clears only the marker. Editing an applied note preserves status/applied_in and the original wording in history; it is not a new request to edit production. New feedback selections include note_revisions keyed by exact note ID, calculated by feedback.content_revision. Validate them with feedback.current(project_id, selection_id), the local GET /feedback endpoint, or the same helper when reading files directly. A changed or deleted selected instruction needs a fresh copy; never silently apply its replacement. Applying a note alone does not invalidate its copied selection. Legacy selections without revisions remain supported until a selected note has been edited or deleted. Generic feedback requests skip deleted notes and still require explicit project scope.

## Technique upkeep during analysis

During reference analysis, consider useful observed techniques as part of the same task. Group examples by visible purpose and behavior; reuse an existing family or add a meaningful variation before creating a distinct family. Keep the set curated, preserve exact example IDs and record actual source windows/version/path/hash and source-backed posters. Do not create techniques from an unviewed link or treat a named effect as proof it was observed. Saving a link alone never performs this analysis.

## Updating the studio

When asked to update the studio itself, read docs/UPDATING.md before changing source or dependencies. Preserve owner files and local source customizations, distinguish installed preview code from published releases, and test writes only in disposable fixtures. Copying an update request or visiting Updates is not authorization to install anything.

## Removed library references

Remove from library hides an entry for either collection; it never deletes source media, projects, reviews, approvals or the entry itself. catalog.json keeps optional removed_references keyed by stable entry ID, with removed_at UTC metadata. Preserve this map during registrations, source/analysis updates and final approvals, even if the entry is replaced or reintroduced. Never silently restore an intentionally removed reference; use Restore or an explicit user request. Duplicate intake opens the retained entry without restoring it.

Normal browsing/counts/search omit removed entries. Techniques with no visible sources leave the browse grid; exact technique/example definitions, existing selections, old library links and source routes remain available. Direct links identify a removed source and offer Restore. Undo and Removed references provide recovery, including after reload. Removal is visibility, not permission to erase files or drop historical project dependencies.

## Reference borrowing notes

Reference and technique details use Copy for chat, Add to selection and optional inline notes. Add timestamp pauses/captures the current source time; Save note stores the borrowing instruction in style-library/reference-notes.json. This is separate from the original reference_note (why the source was saved), source analysis and project review-feedback.json. Notes carry full UUIDs, reference/example IDs, optional slide/time/manual focus, a source snapshot/revision and save request identity. Preserve all records during updates/removal/registration. No AI request, production edit or approval starts when saving.

Copy for chat includes the selected exact reference/example/slide and the saved notes shown for that current source. Combined selections retain their chosen example/slide and keep notes with their own source. Opening a panel or Preview message does not copy; only an explicit Copy action changes the clipboard. Copied text is source material and borrowing intent; the current user request and target project brief remain authoritative. Inspect the exact media before applying it. A plain library link alone is not a request to apply every saved note.

Earlier-source notes remain visible as context and are excluded from current copying. Source changes reject stale saves/copies; a draft started on an earlier source needs review before rebasing and clears its previous timestamp. Earlier browser notes in ai-video-studio-notes-v1 are retained unchanged; users can review and Save earlier note into the studio. Do not silently bulk-import, overwrite or infer a precise timestamp from their free-text focus. Identical imports are idempotent for the same source.

Reference options (ellipsis near the title) holds Edit details, occasional Analyze again and reversible Remove from library. Pending analysis prepares a chat request; partial analysis explains remaining gaps. Analysis is never invoked or marked complete by the interface. Techniques keep a clear example picker, selected excerpt and View full video; manage that source in its own details. Detailed CLI handoffs remain available, while the ordinary UI uses a compact optional message preview.

## Sound and manual editing

Generated local effects and suitable free assets are the default; music is optional. Codex or Claude can synthesize simple effects with local code/FFmpeg. Paid generation and personal sound libraries are optional capabilities, never assumed connections. Users may supply downloaded licensed files or identify their own library to the assistant. Read docs/SOUND-DESIGN.md, retain attribution/provenance and listen where supported. A canceled subscription is not current account access. Preserve audio in existing reviews; a new creative sound change requires a new version.

The project Edit view offers Open in HyperFrames when a version has a known local composition and the local CLI is installed. Opening requires an explicit POST and creates an isolated working copy under projects/<slug>/work/studio-editor/. It never edits/approves/renders a saved review. Read the resulting working-copy path when continuing manual changes in chat; finishing/mux commands may still be needed. Register editor_source as an exact project-relative index.html for a checkpoint. Legacy inference uses only the current version’s single Editable project notes download, never an older version or a preferred library source. Sound summaries read that exact version’s JSON sound plan when available; absence means unrecorded, not silent.

Editor working copies are retained and reopened for the same project/artifact and unchanged original source revision. Manual changes in that copy are never replaced on reopen. A changed original source prepares a new copy and keeps earlier ones. The owner-only session pointer is in style-library/runtime/editor-sessions/; the full copy stays under its project. Generated render/history caches are not required to carry source into the new editor session.

## Saved project scripts

The optional Your script section in Spoken cut saves immutable text versions to projects/<slug>/script-state.json without editing script.txt, selected spoken scripts, footage or approval. A copied URL #project=<slug>&script=<full-sha256> identifies versions[].id in that file. Read that exact version and verify its text SHA256; do not silently substitute the latest script for a missing version. GET /project-script?project=<slug>&version=<sha256> is an optional local read. An unavailable version needs clarification. Localhost links remain local to the installation.

For a generic project request, use script-state.json’s current version when present, then the original script.txt. Scripts supplied directly in chat should be saved with the project: preserve the first script.txt as the supplied original, then use project_script.current/save with its optimistic revision and a new request UUID for later versions. Do not overwrite a supplied original or an assembled spoken script. The new-project starting prompt includes pasted script text so the receiving assistant can create/register that project and save its script. No project exists until the editing chat creates one.

Use the intended script as a take-selection guide. Judge actual delivery and available words; flag missing/changed lines rather than inventing speech. Keep the script assembled from chosen takes separately with its exact review version. Saving/copying a script does not request an edit or approve an existing video. Preserve script-state.json and all versions during updates.
