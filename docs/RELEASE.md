# Maintaining and releasing AI Video Studio

This file is the shared release procedure for new Codex and Claude Code chats. AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md point here. Workflow knowledge belongs in these versioned Markdown files; .env is for private configuration/secrets and is never published.

## Two separate responsibilities

- **Maintainer publication:** reusable application code, docs, templates and empty examples from the clean public starter. A private production studio is never the release source. Port reusable fixes explicitly; do not copy personal projects, catalogs, techniques, media, notes or runtime evidence.
- **Installed-user upgrade:** update application files in that user's existing studio while retaining their projects, library, techniques, scripts, settings, feedback, decisions and local source customizations. Read docs/UPDATING.md. A release's empty examples are for first installation, never replacements for existing data.

## Normal development flow

1. Read the shared instructions, current status and Git status/remotes. Preserve existing changes and make a recoverable source checkpoint. Fingerprint owner metadata and media before release work.
2. Work on a descriptive branch. Open a pull request early or when the changes are ready; continue work on that branch. The PR explains the resulting behavior, validation and any upgrade actions.
3. Run the checks below. GitHub's required checks must pass for the exact PR head before merging. Protect main against unreviewed direct pushes, force pushes and deletion. A solo maintainer need not require an unavailable second human reviewer.
4. Merge the reviewed PR after publication authorization. Do not fold unrelated dependency proposals into a feature release. A renderer upgrade requires separate setup/render verification.
5. Publish a new numbered tag and GitHub Release at the tested merged commit, with a reviewed source ZIP, checksum manifest, changes, upgrade instructions and known limits. Never overwrite a previous release/tag. A merge alone does not publish a release.
6. Verify the public tag/tree/assets and anonymous installation after publication. Confirm the setup prompt requests that tag. Retain the previous release and local checkpoint for rollback.

Publication, repository settings changes and messages to others need appropriate user authorization. Authorization to release application code does not authorize publication of creative media or sending team messages.

## Required checks before each release

- **Version:** package.json is the canonical release version. Match package-lock.json, the interface studio-version meta tag, README/INSTALL_PROMPT/PILOT tag references and release notes. Remove local-preview wording from a published build. Run `python3 scripts/check_release.py`.
- **Source/privacy:** review every path in release-files.txt and the actual Git tree, including new files. Exporter scanning is an additional guard, not a substitute for review. Owner projects, catalogs, removed-reference metadata, reference notes, previews, accounts, environments, logs and journals must be absent. Third-party font/dependency notices stay included.
- **Tests:** run Python unit tests, all Node UI tests, JS syntax and registry validators. Tests that write or approve use temporary fixtures. Run supported Python/OS checks in CI; do not mistake them for full media-platform support.
- **Dependencies/security:** audit the pinned npm, core Python and optional speech locks. Review local HTTP/path boundaries, outbound cover retrieval and editor launch if changed. Keep production tools pinned unless an explicit change is tested. Report actual findings and limitations.
- **Fresh installation:** export the exact source, extract into a fresh directory, run setup, confirm empty registries, then complete synthetic assembly and motion render with local media dependencies. Inspect the actual encoded sample. Never render/approve a real owner project as a release test.
- **Upgrade and rollback:** start from the previous published tag/ZIP in disposable Git and ZIP copies. Populate projects, raw/exported media, references, a real source-pinned technique, settings, scripts, feedback/links and approvals; record their bytes/hashes. Apply only reviewed source, rerun studio-only setup, validate/read the retained records and confirm all owner fingerprints match. Test rollback of affected source while keeping data created after upgrading. Exercise detection/preservation of local source customizations. Record the baseline and target versions and observed scope.
- **Exact commit:** after committing, `python3 scripts/check_release.py --git-ref HEAD` must confirm the committed tree exactly matches the selected source. Repeat for the final merged commit and generate its release archive there, so tags, source hashes and assets agree.

Use `python3 scripts/export_release.py` to create a new source archive and checksum manifest. The default name comes from package.json. It never stages or publishes. Preserve existing archives; do not zip the entire working folder or use `git add .` as a publication audit.

## Version policy and beta testing

Use numbered prereleases while independent-user/fresh-assistant coverage is outstanding: 0.1.0-beta.1, 0.1.0-beta.2, etc. Broad availability does not by itself prove stable compatibility. After the beta pilot passes, publish 0.1.0; use patch versions for fixes and minor versions for compatible feature additions. Describe any data migration and backup/rollback requirements explicitly.

GitHub's releases/latest endpoint excludes prereleases. Beta-aware checks must inspect the releases list and actual version/tag rather than report no update from that endpoint alone. The current Updates page shows the installed version and copies an assistant request; it performs no background remote check or automatic installation.

After the beta is published, a teammate can rehearse the real upgrade prompt from their existing installation after backing it up. Follow docs/PILOT.md in fresh Codex/Claude Code sessions with their own footage/accounts. Record anonymized results, resolve friction in a new release and link the public guide when available. Private media/logs never belong in public issues or release assets. No team messages are implied.
